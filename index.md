# Welcome

Welcome to Ötleş Notes! Its a blog by me (Erkin Ötleş).

For a little background: I am a Medical Scientist Training Program Fellow at the University of Michigan. What does that mean in English? It means I am a very silly person who decided to go to school forever in order to study medicine (MD) and engineering (PhD in industrial and operations engineering). Generally, I am fascinated by the intersection of engineering and medicine. I strongly believe that both fields have a lot to learn from one another. While working between the two presents challenges, I am genuinely grateful to learn from wonderful mentors and colleagues in both fields.
