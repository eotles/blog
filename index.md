# Welcome

Welcome to Ötleş Notes, a blog by me ([Erkin Ötleş](https://eotles.github.io)).

For a little background: I am a [Medical Scientist Training Program Fellow at the University of Michigan](https://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/education/md-phd-program). What does that mean in English? It means I am a very silly person who decided to go to school forever in order to study medicine (MD) and engineering (PhD in [industrial and operations engineering](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu)). Generally, I am fascinated by the intersection of engineering and medicine. I strongly believe that both fields have a lot to learn from one another. While working between the two presents challenges, I am genuinely grateful to learn from wonderful mentors and colleagues in both fields.

If you have ideas about my ideas feel free to reach out to me on twitter ([@eotles](https://twitter.com/eotles)) or write me an email.

Cheers, <br />
Erkin  <br />
